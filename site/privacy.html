            <strong>With Platforms:</strong> We share the minimum required data (media files, captions, metadata) with
            TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms when you initiate an upload.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may engage trusted vendors for hosting, analytics, crash reporting,
            or email delivery. These providers are bound by confidentiality obligations and may only use data to perform
            services for us.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid
            legal process, government request, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of UPLoud, our users, or

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we undergo a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information
            may be transferred as permitted by law. We will provide notice before your personal information becomes

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service.
          Diagnostic logs are typically stored for up to 18 months. OAuth tokens can be revoked at any time within the
          application, which deletes them from our systems. We promptly delete support communications upon request when
          legally permissible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information we collect, including encryption of
          OAuth tokens, secure network communications, and access controls restricting personnel to a need-to-know
          basis. No system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for
          keeping your devices and Platform accounts secure.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          UPLoud is headquartered in the United States. If you access the Service from outside the U.S., your information
          may be processed and stored in the U.S. or other countries where we or our service providers operate. We take
          steps to ensure an appropriate level of protection in accordance with applicable law.
        </p>

          <li>

            will still be sent as required to deliver the Service).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have additional rights regarding personal data. We honour valid
